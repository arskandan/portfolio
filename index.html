								<h3>Master Graduation Project – Soft Robotics</h3>
								<h4>Eindhoven University of Technology</h4>
								<p><small>Dec. 2024 – Sep. 2025 | Eindhoven, Netherlands</small></p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/soft robotics hardware.png" alt="Electronic skin hardware setup with capacitive proximity sensor and pressure sensor" /></span>
								
								<p>In this project, I developed a multi-modal robotic skin using 3D-printed TPU 95A with a gyroid infill pattern. The main challenge was that pressure sensors alone could not provide accurate force estimation due to the skin's non-uniform stiffness, softer at the center and stiffer at the edges. Similarly, proximity sensors alone could not measure force, it can only detect contact location. To address this, a pressure sensor was embedded within the skin, and the readings were converted into force estimates using adiabatic and isothermal thermodynamic gas laws, depending on the deformation happening in the skin.</p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/soft robotics system.png" alt="Complete sensor fusion system diagram showing processing pipeline and results" /></span>
								
								<p>Beneath the skin, a 2×2 capacitive electrode array was integrated to localize the contact point using the parallel plate capacitance model. The raw capacitance decay was fitted with a 2D 4th-order polynomial and corrected using ridge regression for higher localization accuracy. Finally, both sensing modalities were fused: the pressure sensor provided force magnitude, while the proximity sensor localized the contact and compensated for stiffness variations across the skin. This sensor fusion significantly enhanced the accuracy of force measurements and provided the robotic skin with positional awareness and adaptive elastic modulus correction. If the corrections were not done, then the force measurements would have been 11.9% less.</p>

								<h3>Research Intern – Hospital Mobile Robotics</h3>
								<h4>Ambyon</h4>
								<p><small>Jul. 2024 – Nov. 2025 | Eindhoven, Netherlands</small></p>
								<p>In this project, I worked on developing navigation strategies for hospital service robots. The goal was to design a system where the robot would always follow the right lane by default, just like people walking in a hallway, but could also change lanes dynamically whenever it encountered an obstacle, such as a human or equipment. To achieve this, I implemented a behavior tree framework in C++ using ROS2's NAV2 stack, which allowed the robot's actions to be organized in a modular way. Behavior trees made it easy to structure the robot's decision-making, such as when to keep following the right lane, when to slow down, and when to prepare for a lane change.</p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/optimal-membership.gif" alt="Fuzzy logic membership functions for optimal lane-changing decisions" /></span>
								
								<p>For the actual lane-changing decisions, I applied fuzzy logic using the Fuzzylite library. Fuzzy logic was important because hospital corridors are unpredictable and not everything can be described with strict rules; it allowed the robot to handle uncertainty smoothly, making gradual and human-like decisions instead of rigid ones. The full system was developed and tested in the Gazebo simulation environment, where the robot successfully demonstrated both strict right-lane following and adaptive lane-switching behavior in different scenarios. By combining the structured decision-making of behavior trees with the flexibility of fuzzy logic, the project showed how mobile robots can be made safer, more reliable, and better suited for real hospital environments. Achieved approximately 80% success rate in simulated dynamic corridor navigation.</p>
								
								<h3>Mobile Robot Waiter</h3>
								<h4>Eindhoven University of Technology</h4>
								<p><small>Feb. 2024 – Jun. 2024 | Eindhoven, Netherlands</small></p>
								<p>Our group worked on a mobile service robot designed to deliver food to tables in a restaurant. The work was divided into three main phases. First, we developed local path planning using the artificial potential field method, which enabled the robot to move smoothly while avoiding collisions with people and obstacles in its surroundings. Second, we implemented global path planning using the A* algorithm, which calculated an efficient path between the start and goal positions in the restaurant layout. Third, we focused on localization, ensuring the robot always knew its exact position within the environment. For this, we applied particle filters, which combined sensor data with a map of the restaurant to accurately estimate the robot's location.</p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/local-global-planner.gif" alt="Global and local path planning visualization" /></span>
								
								<p>Finally, we integrated all three modules into a single system, allowing the robot to plan a global route, adapt it locally to avoid obstacles, and continuously localize itself while delivering food to the correct table. This project demonstrated how combining global planning, local obstacle avoidance, and robust localization can create a reliable and autonomous service robot. We achieved second position in this project out of ten groups at TU/e.</p>

								<h3>Raytracer Optimization</h3>
								<h4>Eindhoven University of Technology</h4>
								<p><small>Jan. 2024 – Feb. 2024 | Eindhoven, Netherlands</small></p>
								<p>A raytracer is a graphics rendering algorithm that generates realistic images by simulating how light rays travel and interact with objects in a 3D scene. While raytracing produces highly detailed and accurate images, it is also computationally expensive, since millions of rays must be traced to calculate reflections, refractions, and shadows. This makes optimization essential to reduce computation time and display results faster. In this project, my task was to work on the optimization of the raytracer so that images could be rendered more efficiently.</p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/raytracer-picture.png" alt="Raytraced 3D scene showing realistic lighting and shadows" /></span>
								
								<p>To achieve this, I used three key techniques. First, I implemented a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH), which organizes objects in the scene into a tree structure of bounding boxes. This allows the algorithm to quickly skip large parts of the scene that rays will never hit, instead of checking every object individually. Second, I used a 3-Dimensional Digital Differential Analyzer (3D-DDA), an efficient algorithm for traversing a grid, which speeds up ray traversal by stepping through the 3D space in a structured way instead of testing every possible intersection. Finally, I applied parallel computing, distributing the computation of rays across multiple cores so that many rays could be processed at the same time.</p>
								
								<p>By combining these methods, the raytracer's performance improved exponentially, with faster rendering times and smoother visualization of results. Results achieved approximately 45× speedup, reducing computation time from approximately 1800 seconds to approximately 60 seconds.</p>
								
								<h3>Finite Element Analysis</h3>
								<h4>Eindhoven University of Technology</h4>
								<p><small>Nov. 2023 – Dec. 2023 | Eindhoven, Netherlands</small></p>
								<p>Performed FEA on heat sink structures (10k+ elements) to simulate 100 W thermal loads by applying Newton's law of cooling.</p>

								<h3>Control Engineering</h3>
								<h4>Eindhoven University of Technology</h4>
								<p><small>Sep. 2023 – Nov. 2023 | Eindhoven, Netherlands</small></p>
								<p>In this project, I developed and tuned a control framework for a fourth-order double-mass spring–damper system to achieve high-precision position tracking of the load side. The system was first characterized using frequency response measurements to identify its dynamic behavior. Based on this, a controller was designed using loop-shaping techniques, combining high-bandwidth feedback for stability and responsiveness with feedforward compensation to counteract friction and inertia effects. This integrated control strategy minimized the steady-state tracking error to the milliradian range and significantly improved the system's performance.</p>
